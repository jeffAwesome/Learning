## Clojure - 10-03-2015


### Branch Control

* Use *if* for branch control
* Use *when* for evaluation expressions when a test is true
* Use *cond* for testing multiple expressions
* Use *case* for a nice shortcut for single-value *cond* tests

### Function overview

Three different ways to create functions that i've seen so far.

defn, fn, and the #()


### Partial

This is useful if you will have more then one parameter in your function but you
don't know all the paramaters at a given time and you'd like to call the
function now and finish when you have the remaining parameters.

This is also a form of currying.

From "Living Clojure", 

> ...the process of taking a function that takes multiple arguments and
> transforming it into a chain of single argument functions.


```clojure
(defn grow [name direction]
(if (= direction :small)
(str name " is growing smaller")
(str name " is growing bigger")))


(grow "Jeff" :small)
;; -> "Jeff is growing smaller"

```

Now to make it a partial...

```clojure
((partial grow "Jeff") :small))

```
Using partial is a powerful thing, but if you want to combine multiple functions
into one function, you can use *comp*.

### comp


```clojure
(defn toggle-grow [direction]
(if (= direction :small) :big :small)

(toggle-grow :big)

(defn oh-my [direction]
(str "Oh My! You are growing " direction))

(oh-my (toggle-grow :small))
;; -> "Oh my you are growing :big"


```

So the clojure book is mentioning composition. This is something i've been
hitting on recently. A lot of javascript guys are talking about composition over
inheritance. Eric Elliot mentioned this in one of his js talks.

So lets check out the clojure example.


```clojure

(defn surprise [direction]
((comp oh-my toggle-grow) direction))

(surprise :small)
;; -> "oh My! You are growing :big"

```

So this makes more sense now... composition is just combining functions into new
functions
