##Clojure - 9-29-2015


I needed something new tonight, so i'm going over to clojure.


### If statements
These are pretty interesting syntax.

```Clojure
(if (> 5 1) "drink bottle" "don't drink bottle")

```
This will evaluate to "drink bottle".

The if statement takes three parameters, the expression that is the logical
test, the second paramter is evaluated if the expression is true and the third
is if the expression is false.



So i've just worked through a number of ways to use if, let, when.


```Clojure
(defn drink [need-to-grow-small]
  (when need-to-grow-small "drink bottle"))

```

So what's happening here is were creating a function called drink. It takes one
parameter the symbol need-to-grow-small symbol. We then get to the meat of our
function. **WHEN** the need to grow small symbol is true we return "drink
bottle".


 

```Clojure
(when-let [need-to-grow-small true]
"drink bottle")

```

This one is basically the same as the example above. When this symbol is true we
return the drink bottle string.
