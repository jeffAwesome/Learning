### Destructuring 
So I must admit i've only played with destructuring in es 6, but it does seem
useful.  Clojure has it of course.

```Clojure
(let [[color size] ["blue" "small"]]
  (str "The " color " door is " size))
```
"The blue door is small"

This works with vectors and maps. Right now we are using vectors.

You can also nest like so.

```Clojure
(let [[color [size]] ["blue" ["very small"]]]
  (str "The " color " door is " size))
```

"The blue door is very small"
