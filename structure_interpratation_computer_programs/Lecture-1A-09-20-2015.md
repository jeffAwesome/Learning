## Lecture 1A - Part 2

### A general framework for thinking about languages
  * Primitive Elements
    - What does the language come with
  * Means of combination
    - What are the things that allow you to take these primitive elements and
     building bigger things with them.
    - What are the means of putting things together ?
  * Means of abstraction
    - How do we take those complicated things and draw those boxes around them.
    - How do we name them as if they were primitive elements and then build boxes
      around those things.


#Examples of primitive Data in lisp

```clojure
+

3

5
```

# means of combination
```clojure
(+ 3 5)

(+ 3 (* 5 6) 8 2)

```
Forming combinations is the basic means of combinations used in lisp and clojure
and really probably any lisp dialect language.

Lisp uses prefix notation, which means the operator is added to the left of
the operands. Its parenthesized which makes it very clear whats going on.

Another way to think of this combination is as a tree.
