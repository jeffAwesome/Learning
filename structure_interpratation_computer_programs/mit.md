#Lecture Notes

##Lecture 1A | MIT 6.001

Computer science isn't about computers. It is about Processes.

Those processes are completed through a procedure. 

Lisp is the language taught (to cast spell to direct procedures to complete
processes)

> "Its very easy to learn lisp and that shouldn't be surprising. That's like
saying its easy to learn the rules of chess, and indeed it is, within a few
minutes you can learn chess. But of course that's very different from saying you
understand the implications of those rules and you use those rules to become a
masterful chess player. 

> "Lisp is the same way were gonna state the rules in a few minutes and it'll be
> very easy to see, but what's really hard is the implications of those rules
> and how you exploit those rules to become a master programmer."


Procedures are ways of talking about our imperative knowledge

We'll learn Techniques for controlling complexity 

##Types of techniques to control complexity

1. Blackbox abstraction
  * I've ran into this with plenty of third party scripts like jQuery. 
  * Blackbox abstraction suppresses detail so you can build bigger boxes
2. Conventional Interfaces
  * Agreed upon ways of plugging things together. 
  * An example is object oriented programming 
3. Metaliguistic Abstraction (Creating new programming languages)
