##More on Scope

### 3:39PM
Still working through the scopes and dirty checking.

There was an interesting efficieny technique made in the digest loop.

We implement a last dirty watch property.  We keep keep track of the last watch
we have seen that was dirty. Then whenever we encounter a clean watch, we check
whether its also the last watch we have seen that was dirty. If so it means a
full round has passed where no watch has been dirty. In that case there is no
need to proceed to the end of the current round. We can exit immediately
instead.

Started back at it while the kiddo is falling asleep. 

Watch and digest have quite a bit of interesting small pieces. One cool thing is
you can call $watch without a listener function. If there is no listener
Function angular just assigns a no op function or in other terms...

a function that returns and does nothing.

So i'm still going through the first chapter of the angular book. So scopes are
a really interesting and useful deal. 

So a few things. The first is the watch function. Each time it is called it
creates a new watcher object. It is passed in the watchFn, the ListenerFn, and a
new value. The last property. Which stores at first an empty function, but on
future iterations it stores the new value that is passed in from the listenerFn.


After the object creation it pushes it to the $$watchers array on the instance
of the scope. This is how you are able to loop through items etc.
