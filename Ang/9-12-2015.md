##More on Scope

### 2:23 PM
Started back at it while the kiddo is falling asleep. 

Watch and digest have quite a bit of interesting small pieces. One cool thing is
you can call $watch without a listener function. If there is no listener
Function angular just assigns a no op function or in other terms...

a function that returns and does nothing.

So i'm still going through the first chapter of the angular book. So scopes are
a really interesting and useful deal. 

So a few things. The first is the watch function. Each time it is called it
creates a new watcher object. It is passed in the watchFn, the ListenerFn, and a
new value. The last property. Which stores at first an empty function, but on
future iterations it stores the new value that is passed in from the listenerFn.


After the object creation it pushes it to the $$watchers array on the instance
of the scope. This is how you are able to loop through items etc.
