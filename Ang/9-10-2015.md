##Make my own angular js

# 8:52pm

I have been playing with angular for about a month now, and I like it. I want to
understand a bit more about whats going on underneath the hood. I picked up
[build your own angular](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular) js book


I am going to dig in a little. The reason I picked this book is because it takes
a TDD approach which is something I am studying a decent amount right now. I
will start making notes on this as well. Anyway I am going to start the book.
