##Make my own angular js

# 8:52pm

I have been playing with angular for about a month now, and I like it. I want to
understand a bit more about whats going on underneath the hood. I picked up
[build your own angular](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular) js book


I am going to dig in a little. The reason I picked this book is because it takes
a TDD approach which is something I am studying a decent amount right now. I
will start making notes on this as well. Anyway I am going to start the book.

So i've found out some interesting things. Scope is a basic javascript object.
There really isn't anything special about it... but there are some special
functions on the prototype object.

Watch and Digest.

The watch is a function that takes two arguments the watch function and the
listener Function. The watch function then creates an object and pushes it to
the watcher array on the new scope instance object. 


The digest function calls the $$watcher array on the scope object and loops
through it. On each item in the array it will call that watcher objects listener
function.

That's pretty interesting because its a common pattern i've seen before. The
observer pattern. I need to write about this on my blog. The observer pattern
and talk about the angular implementation or the simple version i've added so
far.
