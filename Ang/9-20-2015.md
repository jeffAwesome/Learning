### $eval isn't evil. - 1:34 am

$Eval is a function on the prototype of scope. It takes two arguments, the
expression (function) and any other local variables. So it would look like this



```Javascript

scope.aValue = 42;
var test = scope.$eval(function(scope, arg) {
  return scope.aValue + arg;
}, 2);


```

This would return 44.

So in the $eval function, the first parameter is the callback function. The
second and optional parameter is the locals.

The $eval function is implemented like so...

```Javascript

Scope.prototype.$eval = function(expr, locals) {
  return expr(this, locals);
};

```

We actually call the expr argument that was passed in since it should be a
function. We then pass in any local arguments. If none this will be undefined.

So after looking at this I realize there should probably be some checks in
place, like to make sure the expr is actually a function.
