## Angular - 9-17-2015

So its been a few days since i've dug in to this stuff. Where were we? Oh,
that's right. Value based Dirty checking.

```Javascript
Scope.prototype.$watch = function(watchFn, listenerFn, valueEq) {
  var watcher = {
    watchFn: watchFn,
    listenerFn: listenerFn || function() { },
    valueEq: !!valueEq,
    last: initWatchVal
  }
}

```

So this block of code here has something interesting... The valueEq property.
What's going on here? what is this double negation.

This is a coercion to a real boolean. I think this is mainly important if you
pass in a string or something that is either truthy or falsy. 

Anyway this is how it works. Thanks to a stack overflow article.

someone explaine this double negative trick?)

A logical NOT operator ! converts a value to a boolean that is the opposite of
its logical value.

The second ! converts the previous boolean result back to the boolean
representation of its original logical value.
